        <h3 style="font-size: 32px;">A $1.7 trillion Global Problem</h3>
      <p>
        ​A recent Asian Development Bank study estimated that the global trade
        finance gap stood at $1.7 trillion in 2020. The long term impact of
        supply chain disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside
        geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine war, are expected to
        exacerbate the situation further and widen the gap to $2.5 trillion by
        2025 (WEF).

        <h3 style="font-size: 32px;">What is the Trade Finance Gap?</h3>
      <p>
        The trade finance gap represents the financing that banks & financial
        institutions were unwilling or unable to provide to SMEs. In other
        words, it is the total amount of financing requested by SMEs, that were
        rejected by the financial industry for various reasons, including the
        lack of historical data, high administrative costs of processing and low
        quantum of financing.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div><h3>SMEs: The Backbone of Global Economies</h3>
        <p>
          Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in keeping
          the global economy turning. SMEs account for around 90% of companies and
          more than half of the jobs worldwide according to the World Bank.
          However, it is often these SMEs that are underserved and lack access to
          affordable trade finance. <br />
          During a typical business transaction, the SME delivers goods and
          services and, at the same time, issues an Invoice to the Buyer. Payment
          terms range from 30 days to 90 days, and sometimes 120 to 180 days.
          These long payment cycles, especially for cross-border transactions, can
          place tremendous strain & pressure on working capital reserves.
        </p></div>

      <div>
        <h3 style="font-size: 32px;">Traditional Financing</h3>
      <p>
        Accessibility to trade finance is important since it allows SMEs to
        manage risk and liquidity challenges. Both importers and exporters face
        counterparty and currency risks while engaging in trade. This is even
        more pronounced for SMEs with limited resources. Further, there are long
        payment cycles especially for cross-border transactions, which can
        strain working capital reserves. While trade finance instruments address
        these challenges, a significantly large number of SMEs face obstacles in
        accessing them.<br />
        While they have traditionally filled the trade time gap, banks and
        financial institutions do not have the capacity to absorb the current
        growing trade finance demand due to increasing compliance constraints
        and regulatory requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that bridging the global trade finance gap requires
        leveraging on Web 3.0, blockchain & DLT technology, to bring all trade
        participants (Suppliers, Buyers and Liquidity Providers) onto a single
        platform.<br />
